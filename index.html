  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every Friday I try to have a little programming fun. It might be some tools or some libraries or maybe just catching up on the blogs. I don&rsquo;t usually blog about it though and maybe I should&hellip;</p>

<h2>Enter The Matrix</h2>

<p>Today I started with <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/lxc.html">LXC</a>, the lightweight container technology for Linux. The server guide from Ubuntu is very well written and a great introduction. With a basic Ubuntu 12.04 server install I had a container up and running first try, all installed and ready to go. Very impressive!</p>

<p>I would recommend giving LXC containers a try. Even if you aren&rsquo;t on Linux, and run a &ldquo;development&rdquo; VM or a &ldquo;server&rdquo; VM on OSX or Windows. If you&rsquo;ve ever had that problem of a giant complicated server that does four or five websites, plus some hacking around with disks and file sharing and all that junk then give it a go. It&rsquo;s a really neat way to split up a server without wasting much RAM or CPU.</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s just all forget that BSD and Solaris have had this for years&hellip;</p>

<h2>Yo-ho-ho</h2>

<p>The other challenge of the day was to go through some Node/Yeoman/Angular stuff from <a href="http://tylerhenkel.com/creating-apps-with-angular-and-node-using-yeoman/?utm_source=javascriptweekly&amp;utm_medium=email">this blog post</a> by Tyler Henkel.</p>

<p>So, yeah, Node. I was on Node maybe&hellip; three years ago? Aside from Yeoman nothing much seems to have changed. Express is still the big web framework and everything is dominated by callbacks and people arguing over the best way of handling callbacks. (Not that there is anything wrong with callbacks. One of my best friends is a callback.)</p>

<p>One of the most annoying parts of the Node/NPM installation is that it <a href="https://npmjs.org/doc/README.html">still recommends a single system-wide installation</a>. I have a long, long (omg so long) history dealing with projects have different runtimes. Ruby 1.8.7/1.9/2.0/2.1, Java 1.4/1.5/1.6/1.7. All of these usually have some compiled library that only works on a particular version. The strange thing is, it&rsquo;s actually really straight-forward to just install Node locally:</p>

<pre>
$ tar xzf node-v0.10.25.tar.gz 
$ cd node-v0.10.25
$ ./configure --prefix=~/.local/opt/node
$ make && make install
$ export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/opt/node/bin
</pre>


<p>Now you can <code>npm install -g</code> to your heart&rsquo;s content. Install new versions of Node whenever you want and keep the old ones. Just update your <code>$PATH</code> to match.</p>

<p>One of the big pluses in the Node world is the quality of their command-line tools. They have all the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; features like proper <code>--help</code> text and ANSI colour support, but <code>yo</code> (from Yeoman) goes another step ahead to have interactive prompts. The Javascript community is lucky in that they <em>do</em>  have to account for users who aren&rsquo;t intimately familiar with the command line. It&rsquo;s a very beginner-friendly place and I think there is a lot that other communities can learn.</p>

<p>Still, thanks but no thanks to callbacks.</p>

<time datetime="2014-02-02T14:34:30+11:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 2<span>nd</span>, 2014</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I finally pushed the reworking of <code>grep-calendar</code>. It&rsquo;s a web service that lets you grep your webcal feeds, removing the ones that you don&rsquo;t want. tl;dr you can find it <a href="http://grep-calendar.herokuapp.com/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>My girlfriend lives through her calendar. Having a travelling business and working odd hours means that it&rsquo;s really useful to know when her day is over. The problem is that her company software only gives a calendar feed for the entire company. So I get 10 employees worth of appointments showing up on my calendar. Not ideal. So I decided to write a little program that will filter out any non-girlfriend related items in the calendar. Just give <code>url=http://example.com/feed.ical</code> and <code>query=Girlfriend</code> and it returns ical events containing &lsquo;Girlfriend&rsquo;. Sorted.</p>

<p>To start, I did a little search and found the <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/icalendar">ICalendar gem</a>. Fifteen minutes later I had a <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> app on <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> working perfectly. I was so pleased with the result I showed my girl how clean my calendar is now.</p>

<p>That was the first mistake.</p>

<p>My girlfriend, also pleased as punch with the solution, shared it with everyone in her company. The instructions she gave were pretty straightforward: copy the URL, replace &ldquo;FirstName%20LastName&rdquo; with your own name, keeping the %20, and paste that url into your calendar. Now her employees are, in some cases, about as computer literate as our cat. So I say, &ldquo;well I could probably just put a nice web page in front of it to make it easy&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And that was my second mistake.</p>

<p>Of course, I could have just bashed out something without styling, using simple forms and whole-page refreshes. But no, single page apps are the shiny new thing. Plus they have been around for years now. They must be really mature and productive after all this time. Let&rsquo;s do AngularJS and Foundation.</p>

<p>And that was my third mistake.</p>

<p>Fifteen hours later, scraping in time here and there, I&rsquo;ve finally gotten the first version pushed. Web development feels so incredibly backward and hacky. It was obviously made up as we went along and takes a really long time to get something out that looks &ldquo;normal&rdquo;. By comparison, GUI toolkits can get consistent look and feel without requiring three wildly different languages, or an array of preprocessors, or entire re-implementation of the tech stack in order to get a test suite to run headless.</p>

<p>In the end I didn&rsquo;t even include a test suite outside of the core Ruby algorithm. It&rsquo;s just an absolute nightmare to test a page without having to fire up a whole web browser.</p>

<p>But in reality it was the little things. Like, trying to retrieve query parameters when in JS (I guess you have to parse them yourself?). Or how a big toolkit like Foundation provides a lot of form styling, but not a spinner, which is probably the most important visual feedback you can give.</p>

<p>I just find the web so disappointing. The things that could have been! <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/1996/1/WD-jsss-960822">Javascript Style Sheets!</a> Or even just stealing the layout concepts from GUI toolkits. The web was choking on semantic document layout for years before finally ditching it for grids.</p>

<p>There has been a lot of innovation in visual design on the web, I&rsquo;ll grant it that. But it just seems that unless you are a professional web designer you can&rsquo;t get very far. Why can&rsquo;t my girlfriend, who has maintained multiple Wordpress blogs, debug simple problems with her website? It&rsquo;s because there are just so many standards, so many concepts and so many moving parts to get a bit of text, a few images and a form onto someone&rsquo;s screen.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty disgraceful, the state of things. But you see it all through the industry. Every new layer you add is another layer between the professionals and the amateurs. Us pros do really well out of it. Pity it&rsquo;s so hard for everyone else.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I hate doing backups.</p>

<p>I hate thinking about losing data. I never really had much to keep until recently. Somehow I’ve managed to collect a few gigabytes here and there that, while I could live without it, memories would fade. I’ve had so many pleasant ones lately that I would rather keep them.</p>

<h2>Just shove it in the cloud!</h2>

<p>Well, is that really an option these days? Two years ago it was all the rage. Your data would never even touch your hard disk. How would you feel if your Google account was deleted, and you lost all access to your email history? I had a huge Google Reader history, and that’s all gone now.</p>

<p>Even a technically perfect cloud backup solution can still be taken away from you. Unless you physically hold the data in your hands, it’s not yours.</p>

<h2>A basic setup</h2>

<p>I have a USB hard disk, which I call <code>bananaboat</code>. It contains a single encrypted volume (created using the super-easy <a href="https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/precise/gnome-disk-utility/"><code>gnome-disks</code></a> program in Linux).</p>

<p>It took a bit of faffing about, but I figured out the <code>rdiff-backup</code> utility enough to get a basic script going here. It’s simple enough:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">BACKUP_PATH</span><span class="o">=</span>/media/swf/BANANABOAT/<span class="nv">$HOSTNAME</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[</span> ! -d /media/swf/BANANABOAT <span class="o">]</span>; <span class="k">then</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">  </span><span class="nb">read</span> -e -i <span class="s2">&quot;rdiff-backup destination (e.g. bananaking.local::/media/swf/BANANABOAT/seagoat): &quot;</span> BACKUP_PATH
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">fi</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>rdiff-backup -v5 --exclude-if-present .nobackup --include-globbing-filelist <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.backup.<span class="nv">$HOSTNAME</span> / <span class="nv">$BACKUP_PATH</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>Backup to a directory on the USB disk using the hostname of the machine (I have two machines, seagoat and bananaking).</li>
<li>Read from <code>$HOME/.backup.hostname</code> (e.g. <code>$HOME/.backup.seagoat</code>) for the list of directories to back up.</li>
<li>If I don’t want a particular directory backed up, I put a <code>.nobackup</code> file in it.</li>
</ul>


<p>Note that it really is powered by the backup file (<a href="https://github.com/stevenfarlie/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.backup.seagoat">example</a>). That contains the include/exclude list to use and if you aren’t careful it will back up everything. There are a lot of cache files and things you don’t really need to back up.</p>

<h2>Sharing and syncing</h2>

<p>I do have a couple of machines, and am often reformatting/reinstalling and trashing things. So I use the awesome <code>homeshick</code> utility to keep everything in sync. On Linux it is pretty easy: I put the backup executable in <code>$HOME/.local/bin</code>. I’m still an old fuddy-duddy, so I put my config files in <code>$HOME</code>. Hey, it’s a free world.</p>

<h2>tl;dr</h2>

<p>I’m pretty happy with the combination of <code>rdiff-backup</code> and <code>homeshick</code>. It lets me store and share my backup configuration while still keeping the backups themselves private and encrypted. I can delete files with impunity, because they’ll still be around in the backups if I ever really need them again. Cleaning up files is super easy when you know you can safely delete things.</p>

<p>It also gives a good starting point to using cloud backups, because rdiff-backups are so simple to understand. I wouldn’t recommend using cloud backups as your primary method. Instead, use them to backup your backups!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I found myself doing a little capacity planning for a customer&rsquo;s web service. They were using <a href="http://unicorn.bogomips.org/">Unicorn</a>, which, although a perfectly serviceable webserver, has limitations on the number of HTTP requests it can service at one time. Unicorn uses a fixed process model and requires that the application completes requests quickly. If the application doesn&rsquo;t then Unicorn can quickly run out of processes to service new requests. The resulting behaviour is, erm, <em>undesirable</em>.</p>

<p>We need to keep on top of the Linux TCP stack to make sure that Unicorn is being used for what it is intended. Enter <a href="http://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a>, the swiss-army chainsaw of log analysis. My customer uses it for basically everything. It&rsquo;s a very solid tool, but I found support for logging the Linux network stack to be very limited. <a href="http://apps.splunk.com/app/273/">Splunk App for Unix and Linux</a>, from what I could tell, basically just logged the output of the <code>netstat</code> command. You can see below that it isn&rsquo;t the most parseable output format:</p>

<pre><code>$ netstat --tcp --numeric-hosts --numeric-ports --timers
Active Internet connections (w/o servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       Timer
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:57343         127.0.0.1:51172         ESTABLISHED off (0.00/0/0)
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:46408         127.0.0.1:8000          TIME_WAIT   timewait (22.15/0/0)
tcp        0      0 192.168.1.10:45374      74.125.31.125:5222      ESTABLISHED keepalive (28.56/0/0)
</code></pre>

<p>It would be great to have something a little more Splunk-friendly. For example key-value pairs are instantly recognisable by Splunk. Something like this would be great:</p>

<pre><code>protocol=tcp recv_q=0 send_q=0 local_address=127.0.0.1:57343 foreign_address=127.0.0.1:51172 state=ESTABLISHED timer=off countdown=0.00 retries=0 window_probes=0
protocol=tcp recv_q=0 send_q=0 local_address=127.0.0.1:46408 foreign_address=127.0.0.1:8000 state=WAIT timer=timewait countdown=22.15 retries=0 window_probes=0
protocol=tcp recv_q=0 send_q=0 local_address=192.168.1.10:45374 foreign_address=74.125.31.125:5222 state=ESTABLISHED timer=keepalive countdown=28.56 retries=0 window_probes=0
</code></pre>

<p>This is achievable with a little Python script I whipped up. It takes the output from the above <code>netstat</code> command and reformats it to be a little more Splunkable:</p>

<p>Now we just need to get Splunk to recognise that each individual line from the script is an event. We could use the special sourcetype <code>__singleline</code>, but I prefer to put in new custom sourcetype called <code>netstat</code>. Then with a quick addition to <code>props.conf</code> we can get our events parsing correctly:</p>

<pre><code>[netstat]
SHOULD_LINEMERGE=false
</code></pre>

<p>Success! We can see our netstat events in Splunk:</p>

<p>You can see the &ldquo;Interesting Fields&rdquo; section has picked out all the fields we specified earlier. This allows for quick and easy searching and visualisation. For example a basic timechart:</p>

<p>There is one limitation here: each individual connection logs multiple events. It would be great if we could <em>bundle up</em> events relating to a connection to create one event for the lifecycle of the connection. We can do this in Splunk with the <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.0.1/SearchReference/Transaction">transaction</a> command. Bundle by <code>local_address</code> and <code>foreign_address</code> to isolate individual network connections. If you think that client port reuse is a significant concern, use the <code>maxpause</code> option to adjust how long Splunk will wait between events before starting a new transaction. The <code>transaction</code> command sets a useful <code>duration</code> field, which is the length of time the transaction was open. This can be used for a rough determination of TCP connection duration:</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for a basic integration of netstat into Splunk. It&rsquo;s pretty basic but it does what we want for now. Hardcore users will want to increase the performance significantly. Perhaps by indexing more aggressively and/or precalculating transactions.</p>

<p>Happy Splunking!</p>
